    <div class="article-content">
      <p>My first job after finishing my MSc. was writing training material
about an open-source framework used by several organisations. I never thought myself
as a gifted writer and I certainly preferred writing code than documentation.
Despite this, I felt a certain sense of clarity while drawing diagrams for
the powerpoint slides and writing the accompanying training docs. A kind of clarity
which I could not get by reading books or sitting at classes. I guess the act of
writing forced me to get my facts rights and</p>

<p>Long story short, I decided to created this blog to</p>

<p>This clarity
gave me more confidence to speak up in technical discussions and be more artcil..</p>

<p>helped
be more articulate with colleageus in our technical discussions</p>

<p>Something I felt as well,
is that I could articulate my thoughts better with my colleagues&hellip;.</p>

<p>Programmer, engineer, architect. Pick one. Titles are irrelevant to me.</p>

<p>My craft is writing software which I have been doing for over a decade.
This blog was created as way to share my thoughts with the rest of the community.</p>

<p>Along my journey towards improving the understanding I have of software,</p>

<p>I like to think I am good at and if you think I can help your organisation,
you can get in touch with me by connecting on <a href="https://mt.linkedin.com/in/claudemamo">LinkedIn</a>.</p>

<p>I offer on-site as well as remote consultancy services on the following technologies:</p>

<ul>
<li>Java EE</li>
<li>Mule</li>
<li>Ruby/JRuby</li>
<li>Ruby on Rails</li>
<li>ZeroMQ</li>
<li>Apache ActiveMQ</li>
<li>Apache CXF</li>
</ul>

<p>I am available for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Software Development</li>
<li>Architectural and code reviews</li>
<li>Technical support</li>
<li>Delivering technical training</li>
</ul>

<p>I am somewhat of an anarchist (the good kind) so</p>

<p>I am an independent software contractor living in the island of
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta">Malta</a>. My trade is developing software and I have been doing that for over a decade.</p>

<p>My trade is developing software and I have been doing that for over a decade.
During this period, I worked with front-end (e.g., HTML, CSS3, jQuery), backend
(e.g., Spring MVC, Ruby on Rails, Grails, Hibernate), integration (e.g., Mule,
  JMS, ZeroMQ) as well as mobile (e.g., Android, Apache Cordova) technologies.</p>

<p>My idols in the software industry are <a href="http://martinfowler.com/">Martin Fowler</a>, <a href="http://dannorth.net/">Dan North</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/fgeorge52">Fred George</a>.</p>

<p>Although I consider myself to be a jack of all trades, my speciality lies in
enterprise integration. I have offered consultancy to several companies on how
to go about integrating their systems. High-profile clients include MuleSoft,
 QVC Italy, Rabobank, MoneySupermarket.com and DealerTrack Technologies.</p>

<p>When I am not offering consultancy, I blog about open source software,
 create pet projects, dabble with the latest technologies, or dance tango ;-).</p>
