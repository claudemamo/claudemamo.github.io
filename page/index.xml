      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, I&amp;rsquo;m Claude, an independent software contractor living on the island of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malta&#34;&gt;Malta&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At my first job, after finishing the MSc., a task given to me was to write
training material about an open-source framework used in several organisations. I never thought
of myself as a gifted writer and I certainly preferred writing code than documenting it.
Despite of all this, I felt a certain sense of clarity about the framework while
drawing diagrams for presentation slides and writing accompanying training manuals.
A kind of clarity that wouldn&amp;rsquo;t be obtained only by reading books or sitting at classes.
My theory is that the act of writing forced me to address the weaknesses in the
model of understanding I had in my head about the framework.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This blog was created in order to improve my understanding of software as well as
share my thoughts with the rest of the community. Fellow professionals I follow include &lt;a href=&#34;http://martinfowler.com/&#34;&gt;Martin Fowler&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href=&#34;http://dannorth.net/&#34;&gt;Dan North&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/fgeorge52&#34;&gt;Fred George&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I offer on-site as well as remote consultancy services. If you like how my thought
processes work and think I can be of help to your organisation, you can get in touch with me by
connecting on &lt;a href=&#34;https://mt.linkedin.com/in/claudemamo&#34;&gt;LinkedIn&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
