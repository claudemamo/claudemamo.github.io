      <p>&ldquo;<i>CXF scares the sh**t out of me!</i>&rdquo;.&nbsp;This was a client&rsquo;s comment during our discussion on&nbsp;<a href="http://cxf.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache CXF</a> and I think it&rsquo;s a feeling shared by many. This feeling usually arises from a complaint I hear on CXF: the lack of documentation. However, I suspect that CXF&rsquo;s flexibility confuses numerous newbies and therefore contributes to the negative feelings towards it.&nbsp;The bad news is that, for some, it&rsquo;s hard to live without CXF. Popular open source software such as Apache Camel, Mule, and JBoss AS rely on CXF for their out-of-the-box web service support.<br /><br />With the hope of increasing the understanding of Apache CXF, I&rsquo;ve decided to publish the first of a series of how-tos. Each how-to demonstrates how to accomplish a particular task in CXF. For example, in this one I&rsquo;ll show how to publish a SOAP&nbsp;over HTTP&nbsp;Web Service.&nbsp;Throughout the how-tos, I will assume you have knowledge of basic Java and web services (e.g., SOAP, WSDL, REST). I will also assume you have knowledge of Maven. Maven is the tool I use for setting up dependencies, build and run the apps described by the how-tos. Don&rsquo;t worry, I&rsquo;ll make the apps available on <a href="https://github.com/claudemamo" target="_blank">GitHub</a> :-).<br /><br />Before getting our hands dirty with this how-to, I&rsquo;ll give a 10,000 foot view of Apache CXF for those who are new to the framework. The following is its definition taken from CXF&rsquo;s official website:<br /><br /><div class="p1">&ldquo;<i>Apache CXF is an open source services </i>[Java]<i> framework. CXF helps you </i><b style="font-style: italic;">build and develop services</b><i> using </i><b style="font-style: italic;">frontend programming APIs</b><i>, like JAX-WS and JAX-RS. These services can speak a variety of </i><b style="font-style: italic;">protocols</b><i> such as SOAP, XML/HTTP, RESTful HTTP, or CORBA and work over a variety of </i><b style="font-style: italic;">transports</b><i> such as HTTP, JMS or JBI.</i>&ldquo;</div><div class="p1"><br /></div><div class="p1">In other words, with CXF, we can mix and match frontend APIs [1], protocols and transports to implement a service. For instance, we can instruct CXF to expose a Java application&rsquo;s interface as a WSDL and have the app talk with clients using CORBA over IIOP. But CXF is not just used to &ldquo;build and develop services&rdquo;. We can also use CXF to build and develop service clients such as a SOAP consumer [2].<br /><br />Now that we have an idea of what CXF is, let&rsquo;s follow the <a href="https://github.com/claudemamo/cxf-howto-1" target="_blank">first how-to</a>: Publish a&nbsp;SOAP over HTTP Web Service&nbsp;that takes in a string and returns &ldquo;Hello&rdquo; with the input string appended to it.<br /><br />I have the following class:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/claudemamo/4306173.js?file=HelloWorldImpl(1).java"></script>I want the class&nbsp;to be exposed to the outside world as a Web Service. That is, I want to have:<br /><ul><li>a WSDL that reflects the class interface and is accessible to clients</li></ul><ul><li>SOAP requests translated into object method invocations and method results translated into SOAP replies.</li></ul><div><br />With CXF, different approaches exist for doing the above. In this post, I&rsquo;ll cover the standard approach and leverage CXF&rsquo;s support for JAX-WS. In the Java world, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_API_for_XML_Web_Services" target="_blank">JAX-WS</a> is a spec for mapping a class to a SOAP Web Service. I map <i>HelloWorldImpl</i> by adding annotations to it:</div><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/claudemamo/4306173.js?file=HelloWorldImpl(2).java"></script>The JAX-WS annotations in the class instruct the JAX-WS provider (i.e., CXF) to:<br /><ul><li>Expose HelloWorldImpl as a Web Service (@WebService)</li><li>Set the parameter name in the WSDL to &ldquo;text&rdquo; (@WebParam(name = &ldquo;text&rdquo;)) [3].</li></ul><br />The next step is to launch the Web Service so I can process SOAP requests.&nbsp;One strategy for launching the Web Service is to deploy the app onto a web container such as Tomcat. But this requires quite a bit of setup. I&rsquo;d like to keep things simple for this first how-to. JAX-WS provides an easy way for launching the Web Service from within your application [4]:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/claudemamo/4306173.js?file=Sever.java"></script><i>Endpoint.publish(&hellip;)</i> tells the JAX-WS provider to start an embedded web server (<a href="http://jetty.codehaus.org/jetty/" target="_blank">Jetty</a> for CXF) on a different thread. I give the method a URL from where the Web Service will be operating on&nbsp;and the class to be published as a Web Service.<br /><br />What happens if I try to run the app without including the CXF libraries in the Java classpath? It will actually run without a hitch, that is, the Web Service will start up.&nbsp;The problem&nbsp;is I won&rsquo;t be using CXF as the JAX-WS provider. If you&rsquo;re using the Oracle JDK, <a href="http://jax-ws.java.net/" target="_blank">JAX-WS RI</a> is the default JAX-WS provider since it comes bundled with the JDK. Changing from JAX-WS RI to CXF is just a matter of declaring two CXF dependencies in the POM file:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/claudemamo/4306173.js?file=pom.xml"></script>To test the Web Service, from your console, goto the project&rsquo;s root directory and type:<br /><br /><script src="https://gist.github.com/claudemamo/4306173.js?file=run.sh"></script> <div style="text-align: justify;">Accessing <i><a href="http://localhost:9000/helloWorld?wsdl">http://localhost:9000/helloWorld?wsdl</a></i> from your browser should bring up the Web Service&rsquo;s WSDL. <br /><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: small;"><span class="num"><br /></span></span><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: small;"><span class="num">1:&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: justify;">A frontend programming API is an API for mapping your application interface (e.g., Java interface) to a different interface (e.g., RESTful).</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: small;">2: Funnily enough, this isn&rsquo;t mentioned in the definition.</span><br /><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: small;"><span class="num">3:&nbsp;</span><span style="text-align: justify;"><a href="http://cxf.apache.org/faq.html#FAQ-Thepartsinmygeneratedwsdlhavenamesoftheform%22arg0%22%2C%22arg1%22%2C...Whydon%27ttheparts%28andJavageneratedfromthem%29usetheniceparameternamesItypedintotheinterfacedefinition%3F">@WebParam is required</a> because a JAX-WS provider cannot deduce the parameter name from the compiled code in some situations.</span></span><br /><span style="font-family: Times, Times New Roman, serif; font-size: small;">4: Note that I&rsquo;m not saying this is the suggested approach for a production environment. Even though it takes more time to setup, a web container offers several advantages over an embedded approach.</span></div></div></p>
