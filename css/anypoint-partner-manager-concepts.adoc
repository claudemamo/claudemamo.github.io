== B2B Routing Framework

<content in development>

== Resolution Processes

APM offers a flexible approach to setting up different kinds of configurations
for document definitions, endpoints, and routes. For example, you can configure
a catch-all document definition for a given standard on your partner in case
a document does not match any of the defined document definitions. Going
even further, you can configure a global catch-all for this standard such that it
is applied to all your partners. In order to support this level of flexibility,
configurations are defined at the partner or the home organisation level.
APM will attempt to resolve a configuration at the home organisation level should
it fail to resolve it at the partner level. The next sub-sections  describe in
more detail the resolution process for each type of configuration.

=== Document Definition Resolution

As briefly mentioned above, you can configure a document definition to cover
different message types and versions. Leaving a document definitions's message
type and version undefined implicitly means that the document definition can be
applied to any document for the given standard. Alternatively, you can explicitly
set message type and version to the reserved keyword _ANY_ to attain the same
behaviour. APM will always try first to match a document to the most specific
document definition before trying to match the document to a more general
document definition. What follows is a flowchart showing in precise detail the
sequence of decisions APM goes through in order to arrive at the document
definition to use during route resolution or tracking.

APM comes with pre-configured read-only document definitions for X12 and EDIFACT
that are defined on the home organisation. An X12 or EDIFACT document that is not
covered by any user-defined document definition will *always* match to one of
these pre-defined document definitions.

=== Endpoint Resolution

Endpoint resolution kicks in when an APM managed connector pulls down its
configuration from APM. The resolution will output the endpoint the connector
will read to configure itself. The following factors drive the resolution process:

* Partner
* Endpoint type, that is, send or receive
* Transport type such as AS2
* Document's standard such as X12
* Document's version
* Document's message type

The resolution process for endpoints is shown in the next flowchart:

=== Routes Resolution

Calling Partner Manager Connector's _resolve-route_ operation will trigger routes
resolution in APM which, similar to endpoint resolution, is driven by the subsequent
factors:

* Partner
* Transport type such as AS2
* Document's standard such as X12
* Document's version
* Document's message type

After taking a closer look, you will notice that the endpoint type is not included in
the list of factors determining the output of routes. The is because the process
assumes the endpoint to be always of type receive. The following flowchart
describes APM's logic for resolving routes:

== Tracking

This section identifies scenarios in which Anypoint Partner Manager (APM) is useful to track B2B exchanges. A basic knowledge of APM is assumed; see  link:/anypoint-b2b/anypoint-partner-manager[Anypoint Partner Manager] for more information. For specific information about how to implement APM, see link:/anypoint-b2b/anypoint-partner-manager-users-guide[Anypoint Partner Manager User's Guide].

=== Scenarios

==== Replaying an incomplete transaction

On the link:/anypoint-b2b/monitor-b2b-transactions[B2B Transactions Page], the Transactions View includes a table in which each row corresponds to a transaction.  The first column shows transaction completion status, as follows:

Green checkmark:: Indicates a complete transaction
Red exclamation point (*!*):: Indicates a transaction has one or more errors that prevented completion

After you have identified and fixed the cause of the error that prevented the transaction from completing, you can use APM to re-run the transaction.

Possible errors include:

* Server down
* Dependency (for example, a map or code element) has changed
* Required data is absent

NOTE: Make sure that you have reason to believe that the issue or issues that caused an error or errors have been resolved before you replay a transactions.

For more information, see "Transactions View" in link:/anypoint-b2b/monitor-b2b-transactions[Monitor B2B Transactions].

===== To replay a transaction

. Click on the row corresponding to the transaction you want to replay.
+
NOTE: For a transaction to be replayable, the second (Replay Status) column must be blank or contain a gray partial circle, but must not contain a blue partial circle.
+
A blue *Replay* button appears in the Top Bar.
. Click the blue *Replay* button
+
The button becomes unclickable, and a message that the transaction is being replayed appears in its place.
+
Once the transaction has been replayed, the blue replay circle will appear in the Replay Status Column of the transaction that you replayed.
. To see if the replayed transaction succeeded or failed, click the replayed transaction.
+
. In the Transaction Detail Pane, a link to *view replays* appears.
+
This will automatically filter the grid by *Transaction ID*, so that only transactions that are replays of the original transaction appear.
+
If the replayed transaction failed again, repeat this process until the replay completes.
+
You can always view a list of all of transactions that have been replayed from a given original transaction by clicking the link in the Transaction Detail Pane of any transaction for which the blue replay circle appears in the Replay Status Column.
+
Once the replay has succeeded, a green check appears next to the replayed transaction.
If you need to continue replaying the transaction, you can do so with the same replay button as before, but you will be alerted with a warning before you can continue. This is to prevent unnecessary replays from happening.

==== Common Errors

If you see an atypical number of errors of a similar nature, you can review all of them simultaneously.

The *Dashboard* at the top of the link:/anypoint-b2b/monitor-b2b-transactions[Monitor B2B Transactions] provides a summary of what has happened in a given timeframe (the default is the current day) including how many errors have been detected during that timeframe.

===== To view error information in the Dashboard

. Hover over different slices of the Errors Pie Chart to see what types of errors have occurred.
. To see information for a given error type, click one of the slices.
+
The Error View appears, showing only the error type over which you were hovering.
+
This enables you to look for a pattern among these errors that will facilitate a solution to the errors. This is useful when transactions are failing. but you can't ascertain the solution by just looking at the transactions themselves.
+
The navigation buttons at top right enable you to view the transactions with which these errors are associated.

==== Transport Problem Identification

If you notice that you are getting a large number of errors from a single type of transport, you can sort your transmissions using a filter in combination with the Transmissions View on the link:/anypoint-b2b/monitor-b2b-transactions[Monitor B2B Transactions]. The filter allows you to view a given transport type and see the differences between those that failed and those that succeeded.

You can find additional relevant information in the Transmissions Detail Pane to the right. In the Detail Pane, you can see what happened with individual transactions with which transmissions were involved through a navigation button in the upper corner.

This allows you to follow transactions through their entire cycle, and if necessary replay them through the replay button.

Because consistent navigation is helpful in looking for patterns and correcting errors, many filters persist from view to view. This allows you to look for commonalities across data types.

==== When a Partner Needs Records

Often, a partner requires specific information relating to a transaction, transmission, or document. The following explains ways to access and use that information.

===== Finding Transmissions

. On *View Dropdown List* of the link:/anypoint-b2b/monitor-b2b-transactions[B2B Transactions Page], choose *Transmissions*.
+
The Transmissions View appears.
. In the *Transmission ID* filter, enter the partner ID.
+
The Transmissions Detail Pane populates with information that is likely relevant the partner's request.
+
To copy a long string for partner use, click the *copy* button to the right of the string.
+
Additional relevant information can be found using the various filter and sort possibilities this view presents.
NOTE: You can always use the *Clear Filters* button to get back to the full view.

+
If you need to find out more information about a transmission or just where it exists in the larger scope you can click on the *Transaction* button in the upper right corner to view the transmission in context.

===== Finding Documents

. On *View Dropdown List* of the link:/anypoint-b2b/monitor-b2b-transactions[B2B Transactions Page], choose *Documents*.
+
The Documents View appears.
. In the *Document ID* filter, enter the Document ID that the partner provided you.
+
The Document Detail Pane populates with information that is likely relevant to the partner's request.
+
To copy a long string for partner use, click the *copy* button to the right of the string.
+
Additional relevant information can be found using the various filter and sort possibilities this view presents.
+
NOTE: You can always use the *Clear Filters* button to get back to the full view.
+
If you need to find out more information about a document, or to see where it fits into the bigger picture, you can click on the *Transaction* button in the upper right corner to view the document in context.
